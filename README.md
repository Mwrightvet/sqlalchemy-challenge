SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!

## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
 
 Using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of climate database. All of the following analysis will be done using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
 
 The vacation range is approximately 3-15 days total. 
 
 ### Precipitation Analysis

Retrieving the last 12 months of precipitation data.

### Station Analysis
Calculating the total number of stations.

## Step 2 - Climate App

* Use FLASK to create your routes.

* The following are optional challenge queries. These are highly recommended to attempt, but not required for the homework.

### Temperature Analysis I

 Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?
 
### Temperature Analysis II

* Use the `calc_temps` function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for your trip using the matching dates from the previous year (i.e., use "2017-01-01" if your trip start date was "2018-01-01").

* Plot the min, avg, and max temperature from your previous query as a bar chart

### Daily Rainfall Average

* Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates.

* Calculate the daily normals. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures.
